 # Introduction to Machine Learning
# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

# How it Works?
Traditional Programming: Rules + Data → Output

Machine Learning: Data + Output → Algorithm learns rules automatically → Predictions

# Why Machine Learning?
Automates decision-making processes

Handles massive and complex data easily

Improves over time with more data

Used in almost every industry

# Types of Machine Learning
# Supervised Learning

Data with labels (input + known output)

Example: Predict house prices based on size

# Unsupervised Learning

Data without labels (only input, no known output)

Example: Customer segmentation

# Reinforcement Learning

Learning through trial and error (reward/punishment)

Example: Self-driving cars, Game-playing AI

# Examples in Daily Life
Netflix / YouTube → Movie recommendations

Banking → Fraud detection

Healthcare → Disease prediction

Email → Spam detection

Self-driving cars → Object recognition

# Key Takeaway
Machine Learning is all about using data to learn patterns and make predictions automatically.
